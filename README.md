# Georgia Tech's CS 2340 - Objects and Design (Fall 2021)
## Course Objective
CS2340 takes students who know an object-oriented language and focuses on getting them to use that language in a true object-oriented style.  The course achieves this goal by introducing a design methodology and notation, and covering standard principles and practice in design.
## Course Outcomes
- (Movement - Synthesis) Improve existing programming skills by developing much larger and more complex programs than in previous classes.
- (Accomplishment - Synthesis) Given a requirements list, complete a four-person large-scale programming project that implements those requirements. The project will require at least 5000 lines of code and multiple compilation modules (or equivalent jars) to complete.
- (Experience - Analysis) Reflect on the difficulties of team membership and the challenges of developing software in a team environment.
(- Competency - Application) Demonstrate the ability to use a version control system such as Git to manage team code.
(- Competency - Application) Demonstrate the ability to use standard tools to help with large-scale projects such as automated build scripts (such as Ant, Maven, or Gradle), automated code checking (PMD, Checkstyle, FindBugs), and commercial quality development environments (such as Eclipse or IntelliJ).
- (Movement - Synthesis) Improve object-oriented development skills by learning to think in objects when faced with a design problem. This is evidenced by minimal use of class methods and data and proper use of abstraction, information hiding, and encapsulation.
- (Competency - Synthesis) Given a specification of requirements, analyze those requirements using domain models, use cases, and robustness diagrams. Select appropriate candidate objects representing the problem domain.
- (Competency - Synthesis) Given a set of use cases and domain models representing a customer problem, design an object-oriented solution and document that solution using the Unified Modeling Language (UML).
- (Competency - Analysis) Apply standard design principles and patterns to a problem specification. Analyze a proposed design to determine its compliance with the standard principles (like open-closed, dependency inversion, Law of Demeter) and make corrections as necessary.
- (Competency - Application) Analyze a user interface to determine its usability using one of three standard techniques: Heuristic Evaluation, Cognitive Walkthrough or Think Aloud.  Document your findings in a written report.
- (Achievement - Synthesis) Given a problem specification, design, document, and implement an object-oriented solution as a development team.
- (Competency - Analysis) Demonstrate the ability to derive whitebox and blackbox tests from code or specifications. Document those tests in a basic test plan and implement those tests using an automated test environment such as JUnit.
